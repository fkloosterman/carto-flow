A Python library for creating cartograms from geographic data.

## Overview

carto-flow transforms geographic vector data into cartograms — maps where region sizes or symbols are scaled to represent a data variable such as population, GDP, or election results. It supports three cartogram styles:

- **Flow cartograms** — regions are continuously deformed so their areas are proportional to a variable, while preserving shape and topology as much as possible (diffusion-based algorithm).
- **Symbol cartograms** — regions are replaced by proportional symbols (circles, squares, hexagons, or custom isohedral tiles) arranged using physics-based or grid-based layout.
- **Proportional cartograms** — region polygons are split or shrunk to show sub-group proportions within each geographic unit.

## Features

- Diffusion-based flow cartogram morphing with FFT-accelerated Poisson solver
- Multi-resolution processing for large datasets
- Physics-based symbol placement with overlap resolution and topology preservation
- Isohedral tile support for custom symbol shapes
- Split and shrink operations for proportional cartograms
- Dot density cartogram support
- Rich visualization utilities built on matplotlib and geopandas

## Installation

```bash
pip install carto-flow
```

Or with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv add carto-flow
```

Requires Python 3.10+.

## Quick example

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from carto_flow.flow_cartogram import morph_gdf

gdf = gpd.read_file("countries.gpkg")
result = morph_gdf(gdf, values=gdf["population"])
result.cartogram_gdf.plot()
```

```python
from carto_flow.symbol_cartogram import create_symbol_cartogram

layout = create_symbol_cartogram(gdf, values=gdf["population"])
layout.plot()
```
