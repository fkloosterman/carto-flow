**A Python library for creating diverse types of cartograms and proportional spatial visualizations.**

Carto-flow provides tools to transform geographic data into meaningful cartographic representations where visual properties correspond to data values. The library supports multiple cartogram types:

- **Flow-based cartograms**: Smoothly morph geometries while maintaining spatial contiguity and recognizable shapes, where region sizes are proportional to a data variable (e.g., population, GDP)
- **Symbol cartograms**: Represent regions as proportional symbols (circles, squares, hexagons) or custom tile maps
- **Proportional cartograms**: Split and shrink shapes to show proportions within regions
- **Dot density cartograms**: Visualize data through randomly distributed points

The library uses advanced diffusion-based algorithms for smooth morphing, physics-based simulation for optimal symbol placement, and provides tools for multi-resolution processing and batch operations.

This example shows a flow-based cartogram where region sizes are proportional to population, demonstrating how carto-flow preserves spatial relationships while transforming geometries to reflect data values.

## Installation

```bash
pip install carto-flow
```

Requires Python 3.9+ and NumPy 2.0.2+.

## Quick Start

Create a population flow cartogram from a GeoDataFrame:

```python
import carto_flow.flow_cartogram as flow
import carto_flow.data as examples

us_states = examples.load_us_census(population=True)

# compute flow cartogram
result = flow.morph_gdf(
    us_states, 'Population'
)

result.plot('Population (Millions)')
```
