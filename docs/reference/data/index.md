# Data Module

Data loading utilities for example datasets used in documentation and examples. This is an **optional subpackage** that requires additional dependencies.

## Overview

The `data` module provides convenience functions to load example datasets without requiring users to manually download and manage data files. The datasets are either included with the package or downloaded on-demand from reliable sources.

## Installation

This module has **optional dependencies** that are not required for the core functionality of carto-flow. To install the data module dependencies:

```bash
pip install carto-flow[data]
```

This will install:
- `geodatasets` - For accessing example datasets from the geodatasets library
- `censusdis` - For accessing US census data (optional, for demographic examples)

If these dependencies are not installed, functions that require them will raise a clear `ImportError` with instructions on how to install the missing packages.

## Main Interface

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[`load_world()`](api.md)** | World countries with population estimates |
| **[`load_us_states()`](api.md)** | US states with population and area information |
| **[`load_sample_cities()`](api.md)** | Sample cities with population information |
| **[`load_us_census()`](api.md)** | US states with ACS demographic data (requires `censusdis`) |
