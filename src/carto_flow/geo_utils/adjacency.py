"""
Shared adjacency computation utilities for polygon geometries.

Works directly with shapely geometry objects (no geopandas dependency),
making it reusable across submodules.

Functions
---------
find_adjacent_pairs
    Find adjacent geometry pairs using buffered intersection.

Examples
--------
>>> from shapely.geometry import box
>>> from carto_flow.geo_utils.adjacency import find_adjacent_pairs
>>>
>>> geometries = [box(0, 0, 1, 1), box(1, 0, 2, 1), box(5, 5, 6, 6)]
>>> pairs = find_adjacent_pairs(geometries)
>>> # Returns [(0, 1, 1.0)] — only the first two boxes touch

    """Find adjacent geometry pairs using buffered intersection.

    Uses a buffer-based approach to handle small gaps in real-world data
    (e.g., floating-point imprecision between polygon boundaries).

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometries : list of shapely.Geometry
        Polygon geometries to test for adjacency.
    distance_tolerance : float, optional
        Buffer distance for detecting adjacency. Pairs whose shared border
        is shorter than this threshold are discarded. If None, auto-computed
        as 0.1% of the average geometry diameter (same heuristic as
        ``symbol_cartogram.adjacency``).
    min_shared_length : float or None
        Minimum shared border length (in the same units as the coordinate
        system) for a pair to be considered adjacent. Pairs whose shared
        border is shorter than this value are excluded even when they pass
        the ``distance_tolerance`` check. ``None`` = no extra filter.

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple[int, int, float]]
        List of ``(i, j, shared_length)`` tuples for each adjacent pair
        where ``i < j``.
